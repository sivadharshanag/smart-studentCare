## üß† AI Question Generation, Sentiment, and Posture Analysis

### 1) Resume-Aware Question Generation (Python, Offline)
Use a question-generation prompt over extracted resume text. Example script:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

# High-accuracy but CPU-friendly
MODEL_NAME = "google/flan-t5-large"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)

def generate_questions(resume_text: str, num_questions: int = 8) -> list[str]:
    prompt = (
        "You are an expert HR interviewer. Read the candidate's resume text and "
        "generate concise, technical and behavioral interview questions that are directly "
        "grounded in the resume. Cover projects, skills, internships, impact, and edge cases.\n\n"
        f"Resume:\n{resume_text}\n\n"
        f"Return {num_questions} numbered questions only."
    )
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=2048)
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_new_tokens=256,
        num_beams=5,
        temperature=0.7,
        top_p=0.9,
        do_sample=False,
    )
    text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    lines = [q.strip("- ") for q in text.splitlines() if q.strip()]
    return lines

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_resume = """
    Final-year B.Tech CSE student. Projects: Smart Notes App (React, Node.js),
    Resume parser (PDF.js, Mammoth), Interview bot, Camera-based posture analysis (TFJS MoveNet).
    Skills: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Python, TensorFlow.js, Docker.
    Intern: Frontend at ABC, built dashboards and charts.
    """
    qs = generate_questions(sample_resume, num_questions=8)
    for q in qs:
        print(q)
```

Integrate by sending parsed resume text from `client` to a small Python endpoint (e.g., `POST /ai/questions`) that calls `generate_questions` and returns the list.

### 2) Sentiment Analysis of Answers (Python)
Run a high-quality sentiment classifier on candidate responses to gauge positivity/negativity:
```python
from transformers import pipeline

sentiment = pipeline(
    "sentiment-analysis",
    model="cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"
)

def analyze_sentiment(answer_text: str) -> dict:
    result = sentiment(answer_text)[0]
    # Example: { 'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.987 }
    return {"label": result["label"], "score": float(result["score"])}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(analyze_sentiment("I successfully delivered the project ahead of schedule."))
```

Expose via `POST /ai/sentiment` and call from the client after each answer.

### 3) Posture Analysis (Client, TFJS) ‚Äî High Accuracy
Use `@tensorflow-models/pose-detection` with the BlazePose or MoveNet Thunder model for robust posture estimation:
```javascript
import * as posedetection from '@tensorflow-models/pose-detection'
import '@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgl'

export async function createPoseDetector() {
  // BlazePose GHUM is accurate; MoveNet Thunder is also strong. Choose one.
  return posedetection.createDetector(posedetection.SupportedModels.BlazePose, {
    runtime: 'tfjs',
    modelType: 'full', // or 'heavy' when available for higher accuracy
    enableSmoothing: true,
  })
}

export async function analyzePosture(videoEl) {
  const detector = await createPoseDetector()
  const poses = await detector.estimatePoses(videoEl, { flipHorizontal: true })
  // Compute angles / classify posture here (excellent/good/slouching)
  return poses
}
```

Optional Python batch processing (offline videos) via MediaPipe:
```python
import cv2, mediapipe as mp

mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose(model_complexity=2, enable_segmentation=False)

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("input.mp4")
while cap.isOpened():
    ok, frame = cap.read()
    if not ok:
        break
    rgb = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    res = pose.process(rgb)
    # Inspect res.pose_landmarks for posture metrics
```

### Lightweight REST API (Optional)
Add endpoints in `server` to serve AI:
- `POST /ai/questions` ‚Üí body: `{ resumeText: string, count?: number }` ‚Üí returns: `{ questions: string[] }`
- `POST /ai/sentiment` ‚Üí body: `{ answer: string }` ‚Üí returns: `{ label: string, score: number }`

Run the Python environment before starting the server to ensure models are available.
